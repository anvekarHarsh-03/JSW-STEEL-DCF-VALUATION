# JSW Steel – DCF Valuation (June 2025)
This project performs a full discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation of JSW Steel using a bottom-up financial model. The analysis builds long-term forecasts, computes enterprise value using free cash flow projections, and evaluates intrinsic value per share under conservative, base, and optimistic scenarios.

The valuation incorporates detailed operating assumptions, reinvestment needs, capital structure, weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and terminal value estimation.
All calculations are executed in an automated Excel model with macros, and supported by separate PDF outputs for valuation inputs and WACC calculation.

# Project Objective
To estimate the intrinsic value of JSW Steel (Ticker: JSTL) as of June 2025 using a structured DCF methodology, and to assess whether the company is overvalued or undervalued relative to its market price.

# Key Valuation Findings
Intrinsic Value Estimate
_Using the base-case assumptions:_
* Enterprise Value (EV): ₹192,403.6 Cr
* Equity Value: ₹106,936.6 Cr
* Intrinsic Value per Share: ₹438.8
* Market Price (21 June 2025): ₹1,007.6
* Implied Overvaluation: 129.6%

The model indicates that **JSW Steel is significantly overvalued** relative to intrinsic value under the base-case scenario.

# Modeling Framework
### 1. Revenue & Operating Forecasts
Revenue is projected using three scenarios (Conservative, Base, Optimistic) with long-term growth assumptions ranging from 8% to 14% depending on scenario and horizon.
Operating drivers include:
* EBIT margins stabilizing at 13.5%
* D&A at 5–6% of revenue
* CapEx tapering from high reinvestment years toward 7% of revenues
* Working capital modeled as a percentage of sales

### 2. Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)
Calculated As : _FCFF = EBIT × (1 – Tax Rate) + D&A – CapEx – ΔWorking Capital_
Projected FCFF for 2026–2030 (Base Case):
* 2026: ₹5,202.6 Cr
* 2027: ₹7,732.2 Cr
* 2028: ₹10,898.8 Cr
* 2029: ₹14,795.1 Cr
* 2030: ₹21,927.4 Cr

Terminal Value (TV) using perpetual growth: ₹257,220.4 Cr
Present Value of TV: ₹151,022.6 Cr

### 3. WACC Calculation
WACC is computed using peer-based levered/unlevered betas, capital structure, and country risk data.
Key Inputs (Base Case) : 
* Cost of Equity: 13.65%
* Post-Tax Cost of Debt: 4.76%
* Target Debt Weight: 27.15%
* Target Equity Weight: 72.85%
**WACC: 11.24%**

# Sensitivity Analysis
The model evaluates how intrinsic value changes with:
* WACC Variations
* Terminal Growth Rate (TGR)
* Operating Margin Assumptions

These analyses help identify the valuation’s dependence on steel pricing cycles, margins, and capital intensity.

# Conclusion
The June 2025 DCF valuation suggests that JSW Steel’s market price is materially higher than its intrinsic value, driven by aggressive market expectations relative to fundamental cash flow generation.

The project demonstrates:
* End-to-end equity valuation modeling
* Scenario-based forecasting
* Cost of capital computation
* Sensitivity and valuation diagnostics
